notes:

jekyll docker setup, avoid bundles (it reinstalls everything, dunno why)
gulp for browsersync with gulp v4 syntax


Let's build a website
Simple static system, free hosting -- gh pages
Automatic build integration -- Jekyll (0 config build/deploy)

Limitations: Jekyll version / speed; localization; no server support (no growth path)

Pros: great documentation, built-in support; competitors have iffy docs and steep learning curve

Dev setup
- VSCode / docker
- Jekyll in Docker
- Browser-Sync for debugging / fast reloads
- CodeRay in config (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19332876/is-it-possible-to-use-coderay-in-github-pages)
